	  <p><h4><b>Paper Reviews</b></h4>
		  	  
	  <p>This course is a research-oriented, graduate-level course, centering around introducing both classical and emerging Internet technologies and security enhancements. The course aims to provide a thorough grounding on the Internet and security for the students who are interested in conducting research in this area, as well as a comprehensive background for those generally interested in networking or security. Topics covered in the course include: Internet infrastrucuture and fundamental services; intrusion detection systems; DDoS attacks; malware and botnets; routing system; public key infrastructure; Anonymity and Cencorship; Web systems and attacks; Cybercrime (e.g., advertising networks and spam).

	  <p><h4><b>Final Report</b></h4>
		  <p>A Similar  is the <b><i>Systematizing Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)</i></b>, which has been introduced by the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland) since 2010. 
			  
			  <div class="well well-sm"><i>... soliciting papers focused on systematization of knowledge (SoK). The goal of this call is to encourage work that evaluates, systematizes, and contextualizes existing knowledge. These papers will provide a high value to our community but would otherwise not be accepted because they lack novel research contributions. Suitable papers include survey papers that provide useful perspectives on major research areas, papers that support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, or papers that provide an extensive and realistic evaluation of competing approaches to solving specific problems.</i></div>
			  
			  <p>A collection of SoK papers from the IEEE S&P can be found <a href="https://oaklandsok.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
		  
	  <p><h4><b>Homework and Final Report</b></h4>
		  <p>Homework is submitted as (three) paper reviews for the papers studied in the class. The Final report is a survey paper for a specific topic within the scope of the course.
