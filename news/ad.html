      <p class="lead">Starting Fall 2019, I will be a tenure-track assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.odu.edu/compsci" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at Old Dominion University (<a href="https://www.odu.edu/" target="_blank">ODU</a>) in Norfolk, Virginia, and affiliated with the ODU <a href="https://www.odu.edu/ccser" target="_blank">Center for Cybersecurity Education & Research</a>. There will be multiple positions of Ph.D. students and visiting scholars available in my group.</p>
	  
	  <p>I am currently a Postdoc researcher in the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (<a href="http://www.caida.org/home/about/" target="_blank">CAIDA</a>) at the University of California San Diego (<a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">UCSD</a>). Starting Fall 2019, I will be looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students (with RA/TA fellowships) as well as visiting scholar to join my research group at ODU, working on broad <b>Internet</b>/<b>Networking Systems</b>/<b>Security</b> areas. Prior research experience is not required but relevant background is a plus. 

	  <p>My group focuses on applying empirical, data-driven approach to understand Internet phenomena and improve Internet performance, robustness, and security. Specific research interests include Internet-scale vulnerabilities and security, Internet infrastructure and measurement (DNS, CDNs, Routing, etc), Malware/Botnets, Intrusion Detection Systems, and Web security and privacy. The extensive research interests include the broad range of security and privacy issues on System, IoTs, Middleware, as well as the emerging applications such as Blockchain and SDNs. The major target venues will be the top-tier conferences in both Networking and Security, e.g., ACM IMC/CoNEXT, IEEE S&P/USENIX Security/ACM CCS/NDSS. Other major conferences include IEEE DSN/RAID/ESORICS/ACSAC/IEEE ICNP/IEEE INFOCOM, etc.
		  
      <p>Master students and undergraduates interested in doing research in above field are also welcome. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email or stop by my office if you are at ODU.

	  <p>Check my <a href="https://shhaos.github.io/" target="_blank">homepage</a> for more information on research.
